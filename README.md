## This is for now only a readme for our group, it will get changed when we are finished.

Here are only the files for silver medal, for gold we have to choose criteria for which we can add files. 

# How to work with this project
Here you find a guide on how to install the files to look at the produced website and implement your changes in VSCode, however any other IDE should work:
1. Clone the repository in your Terminal
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SynBio-2025/Wiki.git
```
2. Install an appropiate extension. On VSCode press Ctrl + Shift + X and search "Live Server".
3. Press Ctrl + K + O or File > Open Folder and select the folder in which you directed the installation.
4. Open the index.html file and press either Alt + L + O or do right click > Open with Liver Server on the file.
5. Now you should see the website compiled on your computer!

## How to propose improvements without code:
Just write to Ayleen or Daniel, in optimal case with a sketch when you think of a visual improvement or a text with a description on where it should be included.

## How to propose your code improvements:
1. Go to Add File > Upload Files and choose your changed files or directly go into the file and click "Edit this File".
    * If you chose to upload the files first select to create a new branch instead of directly committing to the main branch and then click commit changes.
    * If you chose to directly edit the file select click you have to first click Commit Changes and then selecting to create a new branch.
2. Add a short description on what your improvements are and if the case what problems there still are to let the others know!
3. Click pull request, you can see it under Pull requests, where also comments are displayed.

### Thank you for your help!

## Open cases
In the following we list improvements we are aware of, but is yet to be done.

* The displayed video on the main page has no control elements and is muted by default (else it doesn't start automatically).
* The images with the Logo are placeholders, hence the size is not adjusted or another image can be included.
* The animations under Team > Members and Contact are quite slow.

* The plate.html works as own .html, but not yet in the project.html as there should be a clash with the JavaScript
* Similarily, the lab notebook animation doesn't work on the website and the current code is faulty, but a functioning version exists (to run it, React extensions are necessary)
